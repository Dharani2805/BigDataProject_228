Uncertain events such as fires, natural disasters, accidents, and even medical emergencies are becoming common in our daily lives . To help us in these situations, the first response is often given by the fire department after an emergency call has been placed. A survey conducted by NFPAâ€™s (National Fire Protection Association) in 2017 shows that a US fire department responds every 24 seconds to service calls. Not only wildfires, the fire department helps in situations such as infrastructure fire, investigation of gas leaks, EMS services etc. The data related to all these events is stored in the department database and is already humongous. For our analysis, we have taken into account the data of the San Francisco Fire Department which was founded in 1866 to provide fire prevention and suppression along with emergency services to an estimated 1.5M people of San Francisco. Every year the department responds to 73,000 EMS calls as stated in their reports. We are planning to use this data to understand and analyze trends and patterns between emergency service demand and the department's response times. The dataset used for this project is enriched with valuable information about the department calls and responses with over 6M records (6,199,147) from 2000 till date. Additionally, the data can also be used to pinpoint areas for improvement and assess how well the fire department's current practices are working. A cloud-based system will be utilized to achieve this because it offers appropriate data utilization along with additional advantages like dependability, security, and scalability. The entire data warehousing process will be managed by the AWS Cloud platform, with Tableau serving as the reporting and visualization tool.
